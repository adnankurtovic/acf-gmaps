# ACF GMaps
WordPress plugin for displaying Google Maps and a marker which location is stored in custom field (ACF)

Instructions:
  1. Create a new custom field "location". I suggest using free or Pro Advanced Custom Fields WordPress plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
  2. On a post where you want to display Google map, set location
  3. Install and activate acf-gmaps plugin
  4. In Tools/Settings/ACF GMaps enter your Google Maps API key (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
  5. Use shortcode to display map with a marker [acfgmaps_single_marker]
